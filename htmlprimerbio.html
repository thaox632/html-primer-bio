			<h1>Zoey's Personal and Professional Bio</h1>
				<h2>Professional Bio</h2>
					<p>My name is Zoua Thao, although I much prefer being called Zoey. I am currently a senior at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities and majoring in <strong>Scientific and Technical Communication (STC)</strong>, with a subplan in Information Technology and Design. I also have a minor in Korean. I have a passion for writing and information design, and always seek to improve as a creative communicator.</p>

					<p>One interesting thing about me is my strong interest in <em>languages</em>. My second language is Hmong and I have previously studied French, Japanese, and Korean. I also studied abroad in South Korea summer of 2015. I attended Yonsei University, one of South Koreaâ€™s top three universities. Along with studying there, I had the wonderful opportunity of working on my senior project there as well; I will be putting together a digital story to promote studying abroad in South Korea. My anticipated graduation date is December, 2015.</p>
